# ATMExercise
Simple React ATM
I put some design to the function and added an atm interface graphic.  I also made the following customizations:<br>

1.) I gave the input fields and submit button a border radius of 10px.<br>
2.) I set the h1 & h3 text fields to use impact font.<br>
3.) I changed the color of the submit button itself and set the font color to be white.<br>
4.) I changed the font color for the deposit or cash back h3 elements to have yellow font color.<br>
5.) I set the root to display within the black area of the atm graphic.

# Future Improvements
I plan to make the layout responsive.  Currently it doesn't display correctly in all screen sizes.
